					&emsp;We got up at the crack of dawn and waiting in a very long line of people in order for the opportunity to see the Taj Mahal early in the morning. The whole palace grounds are much larger than the temple you can see in the photo with a large garden leading up to the main mausoleum. There are also two additional buildings to the sides of the Taj Mahal when you look at it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&emsp;The sides structures were honestly more impressive than the inside of the inside of the mausoleum. They had massive archways with incredible mosaic work along the walls and ceilings. The artists who created those pieces of art must have spent an massive amount of time designing and painting the large amount of surface area it covered. The mausoleum itself only had a small room inside with most of it being white marble. It too was very impressive, but compared to the outside of the mausoleum, it was a bit of a letdown. As it was a burial site, it was considered sacred and no photos where allowed inside with guards forcing people to delete any they saw.
				</p>
				<p>
					&emsp;Overall the temple is a piece of artitectural and artistic mastery. Sadly with how much foot traffic the temple gets, and how much pollution it experiences, there is talk of closing it down to preserve it. The acid rain is causing erosion and yellowing of the white marble that makes up nearly the whole monument. The foundation is also having problems after 400+ years.
