					&emsp;It was decided a few months in advance than I and several friends would go to north into Wyoming to try and see the solar eclipse, but the actual planning was more of a spur-of-the-moment event. Four of us piled into a car, with a stash of water and snacks, at five am in the morning in order to make it in time as we had heard that over one million people would be traveling to Wyoming in order to see the event. It took us nearly four and a half hours to make it but we did it with time to spare. We stopped on the side of a dirt road in the middle of nowhere outside of Torrington. We were probably less than two or three miles from the perfect line of totality.

					&emsp;The eclipse itself was very cool as the moon started covering the sun. You could tell that the light was dimming, but you could not tell the sun itself was any less bright without the glasses. Even though it felt like heavy cloud cover, we still had perfect shadows. The horizon started getting that sunset look but instead of one area, it was the full 360 degree horizon. It all changed when the moon finally coverted the whole sun. It went from dim to dark in a few seconds. The sky went nearly black, and an eerie white ring hung in the sky. I had seen pictures of solar eclipses before, but nothing prepared me for what I saw. It was beyond words. The picture does not do it full justice. The whole lighting and experience required you to be there. It was one of the most impressive things I have ever experienced.

					&emsp;The traffic going back was incredibly bad, with most of it being a deadlock. It took us over nine hours to get back. By the time we all got back we were exhausted from the trip and since we had school the following morning we all called it a night. We did all agree that it was completely worth the trouble and would do it again in a heartbeat. We have plans to go the one on the east coast in 2024.
