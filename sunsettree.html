					&emsp;Just like in Ecuador, I did a homestay in South Africa too. This time my host mom spoke fluent English so that was a welcome sound. The week before we went to our homestays was spent in an ecolodge near Plettenberg Bay. One of the nights had the incredible sunsets you see above. I remember having to walk a little bit into a field to get the photo, and after getting the photo, I noticed that a thisle bush had pushed a spike all the way through the rubber soles in my sandals resting inbetween my toes. I was very thankful to not have to sacrifice my toes for this photo.</p>

					&emsp;South Africa was an eye-opening experience. Since Plett was a vacation town, you saw insanely expensive, but rarely used mansions on the hills above with a sea view. Only five minutes away you would find tin and scrap wood shacks with dirt floors. There was open sewage running through the streets. There were next to no opportunities for them to get jobs or education, so most lived off the monthly government stipend given to them. They were quite literally trapped in poverty.</p>

					&emsp;The subject we were studying while there was public health. At the time I was there (late 2011, early 2012), the HIV/AIDs rate for adults was one in five. That number is very much scewed towards the non-white groups. Even though the healthcare for these townships was free, there was deep distrust for the white/western doctors and combined with the lack of eduction, often times the drug therapy plans werent followed well causing the AIDs to become resistant and requiring a new cocktail of antiretrovirals made. Thankfully the rate of AIDs in adults has drops significantly since when I had visited.</p>
