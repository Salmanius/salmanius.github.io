					&emsp;Theres really not a lot to tell about this photo beyond me finding it a "artsy" photo. I did not see the second rainbow until after reviewing the photo. This photo was taken in a very small farming mountain town in Ecuador named Atahualpa. It was two roads that meet and there was where the main part of the town was. Most of the town lived along one road, either in town or outside. Most people either ran a small shop selling items like Coca-Cola, icecream, or other convenience store items.

					&emsp;We stayed with different families in homestays. I stayed with the Montalvo Family. Even though I did not speak any spanish, beyond a six hour lesson, and my host family spoke no english, I was still able to enjoy the experience immensely. I found that living in the language make you learn it very very quickly. I did not master the language, but in the month I lived there, I got to a functional level that allowed with (with a dictionary) to convey just about anything I needed.

					&emsp;We were studying eco-tourism as an alternative to clearcutting and farming, as a way to reduce damage on the environment. We helped fix rural roads, construct greenhouses, and other activities. While the time was extremely enjoyable, it was mildly tarnished by the fact that I was constantly sick. The tap water in this village was unfiltered and untreated, so it had all sorts of things in it. And while the people who grew up drinking it, my delicate system was ravanged by it. I made sure my family knew that I was not able to drink the water, but I was still sick. On my very last day, I found out that a person who came over to make lunch each day had been putting tap water in my smoothies. Even though I had been caused a lot of trouble by it, I had to crack a smile at the irony of finding out the literal last day I was there.
