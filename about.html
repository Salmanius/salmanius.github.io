			<p>&emsp;My names Chris Cochran as I am sure you know by the top left of my website. I am currently a student at Colorado State University getting my degree in Computer Science, but by the time you read this, chances are I will have graduated, or will be very mad at myself. Lets hope its the former. </p>
			<p>&emsp;I am an aspiring amatuer photographer. I love traveling, and photography gives me a way to record my travels along with generating me some desktop backgrounds. If you want to see more of my work check out my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/christophercochran/"> Flickr or you know the Photography link at the top.</a></p>
			<p>&emsp;This website was less about making something usable, and more an excercise to learn HTML/CSS/JS. I found its not really my thing, but it was a "fun" and "enjoyable" learning experience. Variable screensize is a nightmare for displaying, especially when theres mobile included.</p>
