			<div id="title"><h2>Rhesus Monkey</h2></div>
			<div id="location"><h3><i>Galtaji, Jaipur, India</i></h3></div>
			<div id="textcontent">
				<p>&emsp;When I visited Galtaji, the Sun Temple, just outside Jaipur, India, I had the opportunity to not only see lots of the Rhesus Macaques monkeys, but to photograph them up close. It gave me opportunities to get up close pictures such as this one. If you look close you can see my friendâ€™s red shirt. It was too bad that just after this picture, the mother monkey got in a fight with our tour guide and ran off with the baby. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&emsp;There were probably hundreds of these monkeys at this temple complex, just outside of Jaipur. It was impressive to see so much wildlife living in highly populated and extremely dirty city. Fields of trash, sewage in the streets, people peeing in the streets. It is not to say the travel experience wasn't valuable, it was incredibly so, but it was intense and powerful in both good and bad ways.
				</p>

					&emsp;Another story that comes to mind is a small puppy that lived on my route to the NGO (non governmental organization) I worked with. He was a cute little black and white mutt who seemed to roam like a stray but had a little ribbon collar suggesting someone owned him. I saw him multiple days I walked, and even pet him once or twice. Though about a week after I pet him, I saw him laying in the dirt street, dried blood next to him; crushed. He had been hit by a car and left there. It felt more personal than other dead animals I had seen, as I had interacted with him before. He laid there in the dirt for atleast another 2-3 days before someone removed his body. I feel guilty I walked by his body several times without doing anything. I wanted to get him out of the street, but had no idea where to put him, or what diseases I could potentially catch. The thing that bothered me most is that someone cared about him enough to put a collar on him, but not enough to care when he died. The whole experience taught me a lot about how life can be quite cheap in places unlike my own. If humans were living in far substandard situations, no one could be expected to try and take care of all the stray animals.
